            A passionate developer who believes in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality. 
            Currently pursuing Computer Science while building projects that matter.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Started coding in high school and immediately fell in love with the endless possibilities. 
                From building my first "Hello World" to creating full-stack applications, every project 
                has been a learning adventure.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Currently in my final year of Computer Science, I've gained hands-on experience through 
                internships, hackathons, and personal projects. I believe in learning by doing and 
                constantly challenging myself with new technologies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to open source, 
                or helping fellow students debug their code. I'm always excited to discuss technology 
                and potential collaborations!
